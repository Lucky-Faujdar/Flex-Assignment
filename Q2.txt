Explain the role of the following key properties in the flexbox layout model.

1.	Justify-content
2.	Align-items
3.	Gap
4.	Flex-direction
5.	Flex-wrap

ANSWER:


1. Justify-content:
 (default value - stretch)
It controls how the grid columns are arranged along the inline axis (left to right) i.e. horizontally. Let's consider below HTML page,


2. Align-items: (default value - stretch) 
This property allows us to set the default way of aligning each item in their respective grid cells along the block 
direction (top to bottom).


3.Gap: The gap property defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox, grid or multi-column layout. It is a shorthand for the following properties:
•row-gap
•column-gap
Note: The gap property was formerly known as grid-gap.


4.Flex-direction: The flex-direction property specifies the direction of the flexible items.
Note: If the element is not a flexible item, the flex-direction property has no effect.


5. Flex-wrap: The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not.
Note: If the elements are not flexible items, the flex-wrap property has no effect
